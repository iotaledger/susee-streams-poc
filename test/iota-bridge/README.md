# IOTA Bridge Curl examples for public REST API endpoints

This folder contains several curl script files that can be executed to send requests
to a running IOTA Bridge listening to local host.

Please make sure, this folder is the current working directory of your command shell
so that the `.bin` files contained in this folder can be found.

Have a look into the [*IOTA Bridge* README](../../iota-bridge/README.md) for more
technical background details.
