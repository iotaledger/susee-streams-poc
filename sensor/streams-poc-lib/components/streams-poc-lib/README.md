# streams_poc_lib

This component generates a static library from Rust source code and exposes functions that will be callable from the main IDF application from C.

This component is responsible for following separate functions:

* Export C bindings for Rust functions with `cbindgen`.
  The API is defined in the header file "streams_poc_lib.h" generated by `cbindgen`.
* Build a top level static library from Rust code. The `cargo` build command is wrapped in a CMake `ExternalProject_Add` command.
